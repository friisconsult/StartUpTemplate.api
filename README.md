# StartUpTemplate.api
This is a first draft on a template for creating a Web API and a web front-end.

This is the scaffold of a .Net Core 2.1 based WEB API that you can use if you have a Greenfield API you want to make.

The template have both a WEB page, using Bootstrap and a WEB API engine, where you can implement your own controllers.

Others ready to use implementations are...

* Ready to deploy on Microsoft Azure
* Database connection, using MySQL server for production, Local SQLite for local development and In Memory for stating
* Auth0 API authentication integration.
* Web API online documentation using Comments and Swagger

Please note that the project is a side project and are completely free of charge to use, but it also not my main focus, so there are issues that need to be fixed, and enhancements to be made. So, donâ€™t yell at me, but drop an issue, a suggestion and I will take it up to consideration.

If you find it use full, please let other know and if you want, leave a credit for on the web-site or in the app. Thanks
